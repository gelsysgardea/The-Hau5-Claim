## Fixed api issue error (942ca00)

Fixed: Telegram API message handling.

This commit addresses an issue in the Telegram API message handling within the `BaseClient` class. The change involves re-adding the event handler decorator for new messages, and keeping the token parsing logic within the event handler, but removing the code duplication by removing the first decorator, which appears to have been accidentally duplicated.

### Changes
- Removed duplicate event handler decorator `@self.client.on(events.NewMessage(chats=self.config.CHATS))` in `lib/api/telegram.py`.
- No structural changes.
- Modified file: `lib/api/telegram.py`.

### Impact
- The fix avoids the double execution of the message processing logic associated with the Telegram event handler.
- No dependencies affected.
- No breaking changes.
- No performance implications are apparent, though removing duplicate execution could lead to minor improvement.
